I am a fourth year PhD student in the department of
[Computer Science](http://cs.cornell.edu) at
[Cornell University](http://www.cornell.edu/).
Under the able advice of Prof. [Ari Juels](http://arijuels.com),
my research interest spans systems security, applied cryptography, cryptocurrencies, trusted hardware and
their intersections. I am a member of the exciting
[Initiative for Cryptocurrencies & Contracts (IC3)](http://initc3.org/).
Before joining Cornell, I got my bachelor's degree in
[Electronic Engineering](http://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/eeen/) from
[Tsinghua University](http://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/newthuen) in 2014.
