I am a PhD candidate in the department of
[Computer Science](http://cs.cornell.edu) at
[Cornell University](http://www.cornell.edu/),
advised by Prof. [Ari Juels](http://arijuels.com).
My research interests center on the security and privacy of decentralized systems,
in particular those enabled by blockchain protocols and trusted execution environments (TEEs).
My Ph.D. study focuses on understanding and securing the weakest links of blockchain security, namely places where blockchains interact with the real world.
My works have been featured in <i>Forbes</i>, <i>MIT Tech Review</i>, <i>IEEE Spectrum</i>, <i>CoinDesk</i>, <i>BitcoinMagazine</i>, and numerous blockchain news outlets.
Several of my works have been adopted by industry and deployed in the wild.
I am a member [Initiative for Cryptocurrencies & Contracts (IC3)](http://initc3.org/).
I got my Bachelor's degree from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China.
