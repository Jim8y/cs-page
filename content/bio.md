I am a PhD candidate in the department of
[Computer Science](http://cs.cornell.edu) at
[Cornell University](http://www.cornell.edu/).
Under the able advice of Prof. [Ari Juels](http://arijuels.com),
my research interest is in blockchains, trusted hardware,
system security and applied cryptography.
I'm particularly interested in understanding and building hybrid systems
that enjoy the best of both blockchains and trusted hardware.
I am a member of the exciting
[Initiative for Cryptocurrencies & Contracts (IC3)](http://initc3.org/).
Before joining Cornell, I earned my bachelor's degree in
[Electronic Engineering](http://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/eeen/) from
[Tsinghua University](http://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/newthuen) in 2014.
