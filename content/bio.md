I am a PhD candidate in the department of
[Computer Science](http://cs.cornell.edu) at
[Cornell University](http://www.cornell.edu/),
advised by Prof. [Ari Juels](http://arijuels.com).
I strive to prevent and solve security and privacy issues in real-world systems, especially those involving emerging technologies, such as blockchains and trusted hardware.
My Ph.D. study focuses on securing the weakest links of blockchain security, namely places where blockchains interact with the real world.
My works have been featured in <i>Forbes</i>, <i>MIT Tech Review</i>, <i>IEEE Spectrum</i>, <i>CoinDesk</i>, <i>BitcoinMagazine</i>, and numerous blockchain news outlets.
Several of my works have been adopted by industry and deployed in the wild.
I am a member [Initiative for Cryptocurrencies & Contracts (IC3)](http://initc3.org/).
