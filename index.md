<h1 class="ui dividing header">Bio</h1>

I am a second year PhD student in [Computer Science][cs]
at [Cornell University][cu]. I am fortunate to be advised by
[Ari Juels][aj] and I am a member of
[Initiative for Cryptocurrencies & Contracts (IC3)][ic3].
My research interest spans systems security, applied cryptography,
cryptocurrencies, trusted hardware and their intersections.
Before joining Cornell, I got my bachelor's degree
in [Electronic Engineering][thuee]
from [Tsinghua University][thu].
