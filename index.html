I am a second year PhD student in
the department of
<a href="http://cs.cornell.edu">Computer Science</a>
at
<a href="http://www.cornell.edu/">Cornell University</a>.
Under the able advice of
Prof. <a href="http://arijuels.com">Ari Juels</a>,
my research interest spans systems security, applied cryptography,
cryptocurrencies, trusted hardware and their intersections.
I am a member of the exciting
<a href="http://initc3.org/">Initiative for Cryptocurrencies & Contracts (IC3)</a>.
Before joining Cornell, I got my bachelor's degree
in
<a href="http://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/eeen/">Electronic Engineering</a>
from
<a href="http://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/newthuen/index.html">Tsinghua University</a> in 2014.
During my senior year at Tsinghua,
I worked as a software engineer intern at Intel Open-source
Technology Center (<a href="https://01.org/">01.org</a>) for one year.
